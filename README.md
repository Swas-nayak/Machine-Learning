🧠 **Machine Learning Practice Repository**

A personal repository for practicing and implementing Machine Learning concepts from scratch and using popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
This repo documents my journey of learning, experimenting, and building ML models — covering theory, implementation, and evaluation.
